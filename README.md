# Serhat Unlu's MTM 6201 Portfolio

## Project Description
Welcome to my web development portfolio! This project serves as a culmination of my learnings and experiences throughout the MTM6201 course. By creating this portfolio, I aim to showcase a diverse range of my works from this semester, as well as highlight projects from my previous experiences. This portfolio not only represents my skills in web design but also functions as a dynamic website for showcasing my future plans.

## Challenges
One of the notable challenges in this final project was the incorporation of Bootstrap, a departure from my accustomed coding practices using HTML and CSS. Striking a balance between making the project visually enticing and maintaining a clean and simple design became my focal point. Throughout the development, rigorous validation of HTML, CSS, and Schema was conducted, ensuring error-free code.

## Lessons Learned
Delving into the application of Bootstrap provided valuable insights into responsive and efficient web design.
Experimenting with CSS and incorporating animations added a dynamic flair to the overall user experience.

## Responsiveness and Accessibility
Ensuring that the portfolio is accessible and responsive across various devices and screen sizes was a key learning objective.
